        <h1>A Peek In My Window</h1>
    <p> I am a 46-year-old Black American woman born and raised in Queens, New York. I have started a new explorative journey of myself and the arts. I am pursuing a degree in Video Art and Technology at BMCC. I love nature and images that evoke happy feelings. I am an avid reader, and I usually lean towards memoirs, self-help, poetry, true crime novels, and Cultural, American, and Black studies. I enjoy collecting and trading toys like Hot Wheels, Funko Pop, and Mcdonald's Happy Meal toys. I always find time to travel, and I love trying and learning how to make delicious dishes worldwide. I am currently learning three languages: French, Japanese, and Spanish. I am astonished and delighted at what I have learned in such a short time.
